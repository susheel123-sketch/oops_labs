/*Online Gaming Access Verification: You are developing a program for an online gaming platform that
restricts access to certain games based on age. The platform allows only users aged 16 or older to join
a competitive gaming match. If a user under 16 tries to join, the program should throw an exception.
Write a function void joinMatch(int age) that:
• Throws a std::invalid_argument exception if the age is less than 16.
• Displays "Access granted! You can join the match." otherwise.
In main(), prompt the user for their age, call joinMatch, and handle any exceptions*/
